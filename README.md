# Hand pose sensor firmware
This repository contains the firmware for the hand pose sensor. The firmware is written in C++ and is based on the [NRF Connect SDK](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Software-and-Tools/Software/nRF-Connect-SDK). The firmware is designed to run on the [Nordic Semiconductor nRF52840](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Low-power-short-range-wireless/nRF52840) microcontroller.

## Description
The firmware is designed to run on the hand pose sensor. The hand pose sensor is a wearable device that can be worn on the hand. The sensor is equipped with multiple IMU sensors that can be used to track the orientation of the hand and fingers. The sensor can be used to track hand gestures and finger movements. The sensor can be used for a variety of applications, such as virtual reality, augmented reality, and human-computer interaction.

## Features
The firmware has the following features:
- IMU sensor analysis: The firmware can read data from multiple IMU sensors and perform sensor fusion to estimate the orientation of the hand and fingers.
- Gesture recognition: The firmware can recognize a variety of hand gestures and finger movements.
- Wireless communication: The firmware can communicate wirelessly with a host device, such as a smartphone or computer, using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).
- Data logging: The firmware can log sensor data to an SD card for offline analysis.

## Getting started
TODO: Add instructions on how to build and flash the firmware after setting up the development environment.
